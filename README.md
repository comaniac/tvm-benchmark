TVM Benchmark
==============================================
A benchmark set for [TVM](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm). We mainly target the applications that are **NOT** used for deep learning.


Case Lists
---------------
#### K-Means Clustering
A method of vector quantization which is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.

#### Logistic Regression
The implementation of multinomial logistic regression. Gradient decent is adopted to refine the weight.

TODO: 1. Add one more dimension for weight to model the bias.
      2. Add regularizer (now we simply use zero regularizer).
